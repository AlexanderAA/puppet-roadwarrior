# puppet-roadwarrior

The year is 2016. Giant clouds rule the internet. Microsoft supports linux. Yet
in this strange new world, not all is well. Your home network is still stuck
behind an IPv4 NAT gateway. And your apps still haven't all figured out how to
do secure HTTPS encrypted connections yet.

But wait! There in the distance... a savior emerges! The Road Warror VPN!

This module sets up a StrongSwan-based IKEv2 VPN suitable for use with the
native IKEv2 VPN client available on devices like iOS and Android, as well as
traditional operating systems like Windows, MacOS and GNU/Linux.

It intentionally tries not to do everything for everyone, the module is smart
in some areas (eg automatic generation of keys/certs) but dumb in other areas
(eg limited configurability to keep things simple for users).

If you're wanting the simpliest possible way to configure a VPN for your iOS
or Android device this is the module for you. If you want a module that exposes
every possible StrongSwan option, it's not.


# Features

* Extremely simple configuration.
* IKEv2 using StrongSwan.
* Certificate-based authentication with automatic setup of CA & certs.
* Generate client certs


# Compatibility

Tested and confirmed on:

* Debian 8 [Server]
* iOS 9 [Client]


The VPN *should* work on any OS released in 2015-2016 onwards, but many
earlier OS releases didn't ship with IKEv2 VPN support. The following are
known minimum versions for working clients:

* iOS - minimum of 9


The following are confirmed as not working:

* MacOS 10.11 (El Capitan) - This should work, so we're debugging the config
  further, it could be that MacOS is buggy or needs some "special love" in the
  configuration files.


# Usage

The following is an example of a basic configuration that sets up the firewall
rules, defines the VPN name and both the IP range to use for the clients as well
as the IP range to route back to the client devices.

    class { 'roadwarrior':
       manage_firewall_v4 => true,
       manage_firewall_v6 => true,
       vpn_name           => 'vpn.example.com',
       vpn_range          => '10.10.10.0/24',
       vpn_route          => '192.168.0.0/16',
     }

It is recommended that you consider backing up the `/etc/ipsec.d` directory. If
replacing/autoscaling the server running your roadwarror VPN, you will want to
populate the directory with the same data across the fleet, otherwises certs would
be re-generated.



# Client Configuration

## General Configuration

Simply define each client you wish to use, in addition to the main `roadwarrior`
class above.

    roadwarrior::client { 'myiphone': }
    roadwarrior::client { 'bobiphone': }
    roadwarrior::client { 'androidftw': }

This module will export out the certs in a range of formats and sets up a mobile
config file.

Most of the params you won't need to set, however the following two are useful.
By default the iOS configuration will be "connect on request" only, however you
can adjust to ensure the VPN always automatically establishes a connection

    roadwarror::client { 'examplephone':
      ondemand_connect       => false,
      ondemand_ssid_excludes => undef,
    }

For example, to generate configuration for iOS that will always reconnect unless
you are on WiFi network "home" or "bach" which presumably don't require the VPN.

    roadwarror::client { 'examplephone':
      ondemand_connect       => true,
      ondemand_ssid_excludes => ['home', 'bach'],
    }

The module will build and collect certs and configuration for your clients in
`/etc/ipsec.d/dist/`, for example:

    find /etc/ipsec.d/dist/
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/examplephone
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/examplephone/CACert.der
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/examplephone/CACert.pem
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/examplephone/ios-examplephone.mobileconfig
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/examplephone/examplephone.p12
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/examplephone/examplephoneCert.pem
    /etc/ipsec.d/dist/examplephone/examplephoneKey.pem


The purpose of these various files are:

* `ios-examplephone.mobileconfig` - A "ready to import" configuration for iOS
  devices that includes the CA and PKCS12 certs, along with all the config
  that you might want.

* `examplephone.p12` - A PCKS/P12 file that includes the client's cert and key
   capable of being imported to most devices for configuring. If your device
   can't import, try renaming from `.p12` to `.pfx` and see if that helps.

* `examplephone(Cert|Key).pem` - PEM format client cert and key. Try these if
   your device refuses to import the .p12 file above.

* `CACert.(pem|der)` - The CA certificate. Many devices will want this to
   validate the authenticity of your VPN endpoint. If your device can't import
   the PEM, try the DER file.


## iOS Clients

To configure iOS clients (version 9+) email the `.mobileconfig` file that has
been generated to the phone. Note that Apple Mail and the stock Mail app handle
this properly, but third party clients (on sender or reciever) possibly may fail
to set the weird content types needed by iOS. Sharing via iCloud drive doesn't
seem to work properly (unable to import from iCloud on iOS end).

From the mail client, tap and import the file and follow the prompts to import
the certificate. Once complete, there will now be a VPN you can turn on/off in
the settings screen.

If ondemand has been enabled, the VPN should automatically connect if all
conditions are appropiate.


## MacOS Clients

WARNING: MacOS clients not currently working properly, need to spend some time
debugging this further. This warning will be removed once we validate.

1. Import the `.p12` file generated for the client (eg "examplephone.p12").

2. Configure via `System Preferences -> Network` by adding a new VPN interface
   and selecting IKEv2. You must then:

3. Populate `Server Address` and `Remote ID` with the VPN Name you're using and
   set the local ID to `client@vpnname` where client is the name of the client
   resource defined (eg "examplephone" and vpnname is the main `vpn_name`
   defined for the `roadwarrior` class.

4. Under `Authentication Settings` select certificate authentication using the 
   one we imported before.




# Development

Contributions in the form of Pull Requests (or beer donations) are always
welcome. However please keep in mind the goal of this module is to support
road warrior style setups rather than being a general all-purpose
StrongSwan/IKEv2 VPN configuration module.
